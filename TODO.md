# TODO

## Critical (blocks real-world use)

## High Priority

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Iterator trait (user-defined): generic Iterator[T] trait for custom iterables [added: 2026-02-10]
- [ ] Named args / default params (semantic validation) [added: 2026-02-10]
- [ ] `@derive` macro expansion [added: 2026-02-10]
- [ ] `via` delegation in equip blocks: auto-forward trait methods through a struct field (depends on default methods + trait inheritance) [added: 2026-02-10]
- [ ] Raw strings, multi-line strings [added: 2026-02-10]
- [ ] Match exhaustiveness checking (full) [added: 2026-02-10]
- [ ] `forge` package manager basics [added: 2026-02-10]

## Low Priority
- [ ] Basic orphan rule: equip block must be in the module that defines the trait or the type (implement when module system matures) [added: 2026-02-10]
- [ ] `gg info` command: show fields, methods, traits, memory layout for a type (implement after trait system stabilizes) [added: 2026-02-10]
